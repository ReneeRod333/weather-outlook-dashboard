# Weather Outlook Dashboard

## Description

Creating a weather app project involves designing a user-friendly interface that displays current weather conditions and forecasts. The app should fetch data from a weather API and present it in a visually appealing manner, using icons and graphics to represent weather conditions. Users should be able to view the weather for their current location or search for other locations. Additional features such as displaying weather alerts, providing hourly and daily forecasts, and showing weather trends can enhance the app's usefulness. A clean and intuitive design with easy navigation will help users quickly access the information they need.
